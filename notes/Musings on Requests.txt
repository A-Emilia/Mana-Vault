Different types of requests
 - Get
 - Post

Requests carry a payload depending on the type of request they are.
URL = Uniform Resource Locator
A requests payload in this sense is the endpoint you are trying to reach, e.g. with a GET request.

Is there any reason why the method is not part of the URL?
Where do you specify in the actual Request that it is a specific type of request?
	Do you just simply have a field in the request object that says it? That feels kind of lame.
		I really want to use an enum here that represents a String, so when it is constructed you only have x, y, and z options.
			This would prevent people from just inputting random stuff I guess?
What other information should be included in a request?
How do I make it easier to handle requests beyond just writing EVERY SINGLE OPTION down. Maybe that is just the solution.
Like in the GET requst URL below.

GET
/card/name?q=Jodah+the+Unifier&set=DOM&foil=TRUE

Specifically this section:
name?q=Jodah+the+Unifier&set=DOM&foil=TRUE

With the ampersands separating each individual option for specificity.



POST
/card/toDeck/id?q=CARD_ID


Layer 1: Requst Wrapper
Layer 2: Method/Operation
Layer 3: Target type(?)
Layer 4: Specifics 

Get
	Card
		Id
		Name
		By...
	Deck
		By...
Post
	Card
		ToCollection
		ToDeck
	Deck
		NewDeck
		DeleteDeck
		EditDeck
	Subcollection
		SubcollectionRule



URL = Constructed from information below
Get
	Card
		card_param
	Deck
		deck_param

URL = Target
e.g.
/deck/deck_id/add_card
Post
	Card
	Deck
	Subcollection
Payload is the stuff above.

Requests have:
Method (GET, POST, PUT, etc.)
URL (/card/name?q=Jodah+the+Unifier&set=DOM&foil=TRUE)
Headers (Host, User-Agent, Connection, etc.)
Content (JSON Strings, XML strings, etc.)
